2. Improve navigation & page priority
3. Showcase case studies with outcomes
4. Strengthen social proof
5. Enhance user experience (UX)

## SECTION 1: HOMEPAGE HERO SECTION

### Current Issues:
- Tagline "IMAGINE. LIVE. SOAR." is aspirational but doesn't explain what iStrat does or who they serve in 3 seconds
- Video looks polished but doesn't show iStrat's value quickly
- Visuals feel generic, no clear story
- Comes across as background clip rather than hero moment
- Tabs create professional base but feel more corporate than compelling

### Changes to Implement:

#### A. Hero Tagline Options (Choose One):
**Option 1:** "LEAD. INFLUENCE. WIN."
- LEAD: You own the narrative and set the direction
- INFLUENCE: You shape perceptions
- WIN: You achieve results

**Option 2:** "We don't just run campaigns — we build influence."

**Option 3 (Hero Layout):**
```
WE DON'T JUST RUN CAMPAIGNS.
We build influence.
FOR 32 YEARS
```

#### B. Video Content Revision:
Replace generic visuals with iStrat-specific moments:
- Strategy meetings (war room, whiteboard, planning sessions)
- Media monitoring screens/dashboards
- Press clippings or news coverage on walls
- Someone leading a briefing or campaign planning
- Behind-the-scenes of campaigns or events
- Use real clients (even blurred or from behind) for authenticity

## SECTION 3: "HOW WE HELP YOU WIN" / SERVICES PAGE

**Current URL:** https://istrat-website-revamp.vercel.app/products-and-services

### Current Issues:
- Reads as simple list of services
- Layout feels functional but not strategic or narrative-driven
- Each service has equal visual weight
- Doesn't communicate clear brand personality
- Services presented as categorical labels only

- Strong work but weak storytelling
- Undersells iStrat's leadership position

### Changes to Implement:

#### A. Hero Tagline:
```
We Don't Follow Conversations.
We Shape Them.
```

Present these services with strategic narrative, not just labels:

3. **Brand Strategy & Positioning**
4. **Integrated Marketing Communications**
5. **Advocacy & Stakeholder Engagement**
6. **Measurement, Analytics & Insights**
7. **Corporate & Brand Events Management**

**Instructions for Copilot:**
```
1. Add hero section with tagline: "We Don't Follow Conversations. We Shape Them."
2. Restructure services page from list format to narrative-driven layout
3. Create visual hierarchy - make key services more prominent
4. Add outcome-focused descriptions for each service (not just labels)
5. Include case study snippets or results for each service category
6. Add client testimonials or proof points under each service
7. Use varied visual weights to show service priority/importance
8. Transform from "portfolio archive" to "proof of influence" page
