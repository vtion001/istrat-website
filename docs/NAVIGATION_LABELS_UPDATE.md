## ✅ **Label Changes**

### **Before → After**

## 🎯 **Brand Alignment**

### **Hero Brand Principles Applied:**

✅ **Strategic Language** - Each label signals purpose, not function

## ✨ **Visual Consistency**

The updated labels maintain all existing design features:
- ✅ Uppercase tracking-widest styling

## 🎬 **Navigation Hierarchy**

### **Strategic Flow:**
1. **Our Vision** - Why we exist

5. **Contact Us** - Take action

This flow guides users through a **story-driven journey**:
