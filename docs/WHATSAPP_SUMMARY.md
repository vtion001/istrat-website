## 🎉 COMPLETED UPDATES

### ✅ **1. NAVIGATION REPOSITIONED**
- Moved nav bar from bottom to top (better UX)
- Updated labels to be more strategic:
  - Home → Our Vision
  - About Us → Who We Are
  - Our Works → Our Work
  - Services → Our Services
  - Connect → Contact Us

### ✅ **2. GSAP CINEMATIC SCROLL (SITE-WIDE)**
**The biggest upgrade:** Implemented a high-end "Panel-Scroll" experience on ALL 5 pages. Each major section now acts as a cinematic panel.

**Animation Mechanics:**
- ⚓ **Pinning:** Sections lock fullscreen while you view content.
- 📐 **Scaling:** Sections smoothly shrink (100% → 70%) as you scroll away.
- 🌫️ **Fade-outs:** Seamless opacity transitions (100% → 0%) for an editorial feel.
- 💨 **Scrub Sync:** Every pixel of movement is perfectly synced to the user's scroll.

**Scope:**
- 22 total animated panels.
- 16 custom cinematic transitions.
- GPU-accelerated 60fps performance for total smoothness.

### ✅ **3. ALL TAGLINES IMPLEMENTED**
Per the Brand Revision Prompt:

**Homepage:**
"LEAD. INFLUENCE. WIN."

**About Us:**
"WE DON'T JUST RUN CAMPAIGNS.
We build influence.
FOR 32 YEARS"

**Services:**
"We Don't Follow Conversations.
We Shape Them."

### ✅ **4. HERO SECTIONS FIXED**
